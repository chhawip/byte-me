      <h3 class="mini">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="content">A cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do Before a cyclone</h3>
      <p class="content">Check the house, secure loose tiles and repair doors and windows. Remove dying trees near the house and anchor removable objects which can fly in cyclonic winds. Keep ready hurricane lantern filled with kerosene, battery operated torches and sufficient dry cells. Keep dry non-perishable food ready for emergency.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do During a cyclone</h3>
      <p class="content">Listen to All India Radio for forecasts and warnings. Share information but don't spread rumours. Evacuate when the Government authorities instruct after closing the doors and windows securely. Don't stay back. Carry extra food, stove, drinking water, torch, battery, transistor, and essential medicine while evacuating. Switch off the main switch of your house before evacuation. Take care of the old and young. All family members remain close. Switch of all electrical appliances. Stay in an empty room. Movable items should be kept securely tied. Try to help your neighbours, but don't go out during cyclone.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do After a cyclone</h3>
      <p class="content">Those who shifted to the cyclone centre must remain there till instructions are received. Strictly avoid loose electrical wires after the cyclone. Beware of snakes and other animals immediately after the cyclone. Clear debris and carcasses from/near the premise after the cyclone. Report losses truthfully and accurately to the authorities.</p>
