      <h3 class="mini">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="content">A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do Before a Thunderstorm</h3>
      <p class="content">Remove dead tree branches near your house which could ignite and cause a fire if struck by lightning. Unplug all appliances before the storm hits to prevent power surges. Close blinds and shades.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do During a Thunderstorm</h3>
      <p class="content">Keep away from windows. Avoid using the phone. Telephone lines can conduct electricity. Stay away from faucets, sinks and bathtubs. If you are in or near water, go to land immediately and find the best shelter you can— preferably inside a building rather than a car. If you're in a car, keep the windows closed. Pull to the side of the road to wait until the heavy rain subsides. Keep away from trees that could fall on your car. If you are outside, find a location that is not likely to flood. Avoid tall structures, such as towers, trees, fences, telephone lines or power lines. Squat low to the ground and assume a tucked position. Place your hands on your knees with your head tucked between them. Try to touch as little of your body to the ground as possible. Do not lie flat on the ground, as your fully-extended body will provide a larger surface to conduct electricity.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do After a Thunderstorm</h3>
      <p class="content">Once lightning has struck a person or an object, the person or object does not carry a charge and cannot harm you. So don't be afraid to touch or assist a person who needs help. Administer first aid or CPR immediately. A lightning victim usually suffers burns in two places on the body—where the lightning entered and where it exited.</p>
