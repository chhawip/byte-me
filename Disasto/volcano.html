      <h3 class="mini">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="content">A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do Before a volcanic erruption</h3>
      <p class="content">Each one should be aware of the dangers that volcanic eruptions pose to lives and be prepared to face whatever circumstances the eruption may bring. Prepare all necessary things to bring once evacuation is needed. Those in danger zones are warned when to evacuate. Once given the signal refrain from saying you will be all right. Refusing to evacuate will pose more serious problems. Store as much food, water, light sources and batteries that are very useful in case of emergency.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do During a volcanic erruption</h3>
      <p class="content">Avoid all low-lying places because lava flows and mudflows are more likely to pass here. Seek cover in case of ash falls rock falls. Use masks and cover your mouth and nose to avoid breathing in ashes. If you are inside a house; close all doors and windows to avoid ashes from getting inside. Always stay indoors. Stay in the evacuation center until further instructions. Do not attempt to leave the place unless told to do. Keep a watchful eye on the kids because they might be tempted to go out and see whatâ€™s going on outside.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do After a volcanic erruption</h3>
      <p class="content">Go back to your house but leave the kids behind someone who can take care of them while you check your house. Clean everything around and check all damages incurred. Use masks while cleaning ash and other debris. Wait for further announcements related to the volcano activities. Make sure that your house is still safe for all of you. Volcanic eruptions could be handled easier than earthquakes because there are early signs before the actual eruption so you are already prepared at the time of eruption. Always take precautionary measures in order to avoid serious problems.</p>
