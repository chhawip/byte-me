      <h3 class="mini">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="content">A tsunami or tidal wave, also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water.Tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer. Rather than appearing as a breaking wave, a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do Before a Tsunami</h3>
      <p class="content">Establish whether your home and other places you frequent are in tsunami hazard areas. Know how high above sea level your street is and how far it is from the coast. Evacuation orders may be based on those figures. Cobble together an emergency supplies kit. Plan your escape and evacuation routes. From the Red Cross: “If possible, pick areas 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level or go as far as 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland, away from the coastline. If you cannot get this high or far, go as high or far as you can. Every foot inland or upward may make a difference. You should be able to reach your safe location on foot within 15 minutes.”  Practice evacuating. Know your children’s school evacuation plans and figure out how to get them. Tourists should get familiar with evacuation information. </p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do During a Tsunami</h3>
      <p class="content">If there’s an earthquake while you are on the coast and indoors, drop, cover and hold on. If you’re outside, stay away from falling objects. When the shaking is over, move quickly to inland, higher ground. Go on foot if you can. Stay there until officials say it’s all clear. Bring your animals if you evacuate. Bring your preparedness kit. Listen to official sources such as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather radio or the U.S. Coast Guard emergency frequency station if a tsunami watch has been issued.</p>
      <h3 class="mini">What to Do After a Tsunami</h3>
      <p class="content">Tell family and friends you’re OK. Keep tuned in to official information sources or local media. Don’t assume the danger is over after the first wave. The next one might be bigger. Call authorities if someone needs to be rescued. Help people such as the elderly, infants and people with disabilities. Stay away from disaster zones and out of buildings that have water around them. Be cautious when re-entering buildings and cleaning up. </p>
